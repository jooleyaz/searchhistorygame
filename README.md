# searchhistorygame
Concept: Like photo roulette, but for things friends have googled

Prerequisites:
- Must be a google chrome user (for now)

How to play (to be implemented soon ðŸ’€):
- Go to chrome's "history" page
- In the search bar, enter "www.google.com"
- Select as much as you want, starting from the date listing and ending after the "www.google.com" listing
- Copy (ctrl-c) and paste (ctrl-v) into the game for player 1
- Player 2 does the same steps
- Play until desired to stop!!

DEV TO-DOS
- DONE: save user-inputted data into a list when submit is clicked, for each player
- DONE: make sure the list only includes what's searched, ignoring "google.com" and the dates (every other entry)
- clean up code
- on the next page, when button is clicked, display a random list entry
- in the entry box, if 1 or 2 is clicked (make this into buttons with player name later), the right answer is displayed and score is updated
- figure out how to make a multiplayer thing where players can enter a code on their computer, join the code lobby, each person enters their prompts, then the same thing is displayed on each device
- make it look pretty!!
